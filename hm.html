    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>| Launched in 1991 in a small town in Sri Lanka, currently trying to make something of herself in Toronto, Canada. |</p>

    <p>Hi my name is Asangi and I'm a sucker for art, stationery, comedy, food, candles and travelling! I feel this means I have a creative outlook on life, but will eventually die from eating too much pizza and drinking too much coffee in my parents basement filled with paintings and candles with 'Friends' playing in the background.</p>

    <p>But on a more professional note, I am currently your average unemployed undergrad drowning in debt. I decided to learn coding since web designing intrigued me so let's see where that would take me this year. </p>

    <p>I was kind of a big deal in highschool being an all-rounder and what not and sadly I'm still trying to bask in that fading glory which ended more than 6 years ago. Speaking of highschool times, I have had a part to play in terms of creativity in every single play, concert, club event that occurred during my reign. Please refer to my 'Amateur skills' section for further details. </p>
